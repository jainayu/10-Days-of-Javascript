## Day 0

**On Day zero I learnt JavaScript Basics:**
- Lexical Structure
- Character Set
- Printing Output
- Comments
- Block Comments
- Literals
- Identifiers
- Optional Semicolon

Also all the JavaScript's Data Types:

The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:
- A primitive value or data type is data that is not an object and has no methods. All primitives are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed. There are six primitive types:
  - Number
  - String
  - Boolean
  - Symbol
  - Null
  - Undefined
- The seventh data type is Object
