- Functions in JavaScript
  
  Functions in JavaScript are declared using the function keyword. A function declaration creates a function that's a Function object having all the properties, methods, and behaviors of Function objects. By default, functions return the value undefined; to return any other value, the function must have a return statement that consists of the return keyword followed by the value to be returned (this can be a literal value, a variable, or even a call to a function).
