## Day 2

**On day two I learnt:**

- If-Else Conditional Statements
- JavaScript Comparison Operators
  - Equality Operators
    - Equality `(==)`
    - Inequality `(!=)`
    - dentity or Strict Equality `(===)`
    - Non-Identity or Strict Inequality `(!==)`
  - Relational Operators
    - Greater Than Operator `(>)`
    - Greater Than or Equal Operator `(>=)`
    - Less Than Operator `(<)`
    - Less Than or Equal Operator `(<=)`
  - Logical Operators
    - Logical AND `(&&)`
    - Logical OR `(||)`
    - Logical NOT `(!)`
- Falsy Values

  The following six values are known as Falsy values, meaning they evaluate to false:
  - false
  - undefined
  - null
  - 0
  - NaN
  - "" (i.e., the empty string)

  All other values, including all objects, evaluate to true when used as the condition in a conditional statement.
  
- JavaScript Switch Statements
  - The `default` Clause
  - The `break;` Statement
  - Multi-Criteria Case

- JavaScript Strings Basics
  - String Constructor
  - Methods
  
- JavaScript Loops

	Loops are a quick and easy way to repeatedly perform a series of instructions, and they are typically run a finite number of times. JavaScript has the following types of loops:
  - for
  - while
  - do-while
  - for-in
  - for-of
