## Day 4

**On day four I learnt:**
- Objects in JavaScript
  We define the following:
    - *Object*: A collection of properties.
    - *Property*: An association between a name (i.e., key) and a value. Note that when the value associated with a key is a function, we call the property a method. A property name can be any valid string, or anything that can be converted into a string (including the empty string).

  Let's say we have an object *objectName* named and a property named *propertyName*. We can access this property in the following ways:
    - Dot Notation: Call `objectName.propertyName`.
    - Bracket Notation: Call `objectName['propertyName']`. Note that *propertyName* must be enclosed in string quotes and is case-sensitive. Any property name that's not a valid JavaScript identifier (e.g., starts with a number, contains a space or hyphen, etc.) can only be accessed using bracket notation. This type of notation is also good to use when property names are dynamically determined (i.e., not known until runtime).
